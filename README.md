# Fox Vision (Viso Fox)
Fox vision (FoxVision16) is a 16 bit RISC system designed to be simple to write code for and easy to implement.

## Project
The project is composed of three different parts:
- `Fox16ASM` - An assembler which converts .fox16 assembly files into machine code
- `FoxVision` - A virtual machine that executes ROM files 
- `Fox16Shared` - Shared code between the assembler and virtual machine
